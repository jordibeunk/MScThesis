# MSc_Thesis
Decomposition of the AMOC using CMIP6 model output

The different folders contain scripts where data is extracted from the CEDA Archive (models_r&s), scripts that are used to check different results (checks) and scripts that compute data and writes it to a specific file (data_to_file). Additionally, scripts are added that are used to plot the results of this MSc Thesis. The file plot_componentsBS contains the main results, where transport through the cross section is corrected for Bering Strait (BS) throughflow.
